# QUIPP-pipeline
Privacy preserving synthetic data generation workflows

Collaboration / project management is in the [QUIPP-collab](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/QUIPP-collab) repo.

Currently, this repository holds our initial attempts at creating workflows for synthetic population generation, 
using a variety of methods as implemented by several libraries.

Contents:
 - `datasets`: A few (public, open) datasets that we use as input to the methods are reproduced here where licence and
   size permit
 - `methods`: One directory per library/tool, implementing a complete workflow (to begin with: just the synthesis step)
