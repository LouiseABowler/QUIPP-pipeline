    "The `humanleague` package contains implementations of iterative propotional fitting and quasirandom integer without-replacement sampling algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by following the first stage of an example of population generation set out in \"Microsimulation for Demography\" (Lomax and Smith, 2017). The aim is to generate a representative population of 254,096 people who each have the following properties: MSOA (area; see below), sex, age in years, and ethnicity. In the paper, the generated population is then used to perform a dynamic microsimulation of the population through time (fertility and mortality rates are applied based on individuals' characterstics). Here, we'll focus on the first, static, microsimulation where the population is generated from two datasets that cannot be directly combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will combine the two datasets from the 2011 census using both iterative proportional fitting and quasirandom integer sampling. The `humanleague` package implements these algorithms in C++, which can be accessed through either Python or R."
